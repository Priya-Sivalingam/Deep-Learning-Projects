# Deep-Learning-Projects
# **Introduction**
This report outlines the process of building and tuning a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) 
classifier to distinguish between images of dogs and cats. The model was trained using TensorFlow 
and Keras, and hyperparameter tuning was performed using Weights & Biases (W&B) to optimize the 
model's performance.
# **Dataset**
The dataset used consists of images of dogs and cats, with separate directories for training and 
testing data. The data was loaded using TensorFlow's image_dataset_from_directory function.
â€¢ Image Loading: The dataset is loaded using tf.keras.utils.image_dataset_from_directory
from the specified directories for training and testing data

# **Hyperparameter tunning**
To Imporove Model we need to do **Hyperparameter tunning** with W&B

- first setup the W&B 
- Then set sweep configuartion
- train the model again
- find good parameter using W&B graphs

# **Try with different optimizers**
- Based on the training results for each optimizer, we can compare their performance in terms of accuracy and loss for both training and validation datasets. Here is a summary of the final epoch results for each optimizer:
  
| Optimizer        | Training Loss | Training Accuracy | Validation Loss | Validation Accuracy |
|------------------|---------------|-------------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| SGD              | 0.6917        | 0.5642            | 0.6933          | 0.5000              |
| SGD with Momentum| 0.6909        | 0.5312            | 0.6859          | 0.6081              |
| RMSProp          | 0.4287        | 0.8212            | 0.4000          | 0.8514              |
| Adagrad          | 0.3873        | 0.8420            | 0.3858          | 0.8243              |
| Adam             | 0.0439        | 0.9931            | 0.0217          | 1.0000              |
